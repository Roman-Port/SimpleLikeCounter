# SimpleLikeCounter
A quick and simple like counter that I created for my Pebble appstore.

> Supports app verification to make sure the requested ID exists in the database.

> Could support user ID verification in the future. Because of how I get a user ID, this isn't possible in my situtation. Add it if you'd like to.

> Ability to check status without adding or removing a like.

> No like/dislike spam. Each user ID is stored with the app, so you cannot add a like if the app already has one from you.

> Built with PHP/MySQL. Designed for the web.
